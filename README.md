# Amortization Table System
This project is an Angular application designed to generate amortization tables for loans. The system provides two different amortization systems: German and French. Users can simulate loans by inputting the loan amount, interest rate, and duration, and the application will generate a table displaying the payment schedule.

## Getting Started

To use this Loan Management System, follow the instructions below:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

5. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running the following command:

   ```shell
   ng serve
   ```

6. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to access the Loan Management System.

## Usage

Upon accessing the Loan Management System, users will be required to sign in with their respective user roles: admin, assessor, or user. Each user role provides different functionalities and access levels within the system.

### Admin

As an admin, you have the following capabilities:

- Create banks: You can create banks by providing the necessary details such as the bank name, address, and contact information.
- Assign assessors: You can assign assessors to specific banks. This allows assessors to manage tax values and deadlines for the assigned bank.

### Assessor

As an assessor, you have the following capabilities:

- Manage tax values: You can set and update tax values for different loan types and durations.
- Manage deadlines: You can define deadlines for loan payments and update them as necessary.

### User

As a user, you have the following capabilities:

- Loan Simulation: You can perform loan simulations using two different amortization systems: German and French. The simulation provides a table displaying the payment schedule, including details such as principal, interest, and remaining balance.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Angular application structure. The main components and files include:

- **src/app**: This directory contains the main application components, services, and modules.
- **src/app/components**: This directory contains the individual components used within the application, such as login, loan simulation, and admin panels.
- **src/app/services**: This directory contains the services responsible for handling API requests and data management.
- **src/app/models**: This directory contains the models used to structure the data within the application.
- **src/app/shared**: This directory contains shared components, directives, and utilities used across multiple components.

## Technologies Used

The Loan Management System is developed using the following technologies:

- Angular: A popular TypeScript-based framework for building web applications.
- Bootstrap: A CSS framework that provides pre-designed components and utilities for responsive web design.
- HTML: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- CSS: The style sheet language used for styling the web pages.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
